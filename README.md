## Waldo (A Photo Tagging App)

Based on Where's Waldo (or Where's Wally), this is a photo-tagging game in which you need to search for and tag the 3 characters.
Players are timed and their score is kept.
The top 10 fastest players get their names displayed on the scoreboard at the end.

Featuring: TypeScript, React, and Firebase.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` or `yarn` installed globally on your machine.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Reflection

  This was a project built for The Odin Project to show off the skills that I have learned thus far, as well as an opportunity to learn TypeScript and styled-components. TypeScript is outside of the scope of The Odin Project, and us such, my learning was 100% self-directed. 
  
  Implementing TypeScript was daunting at first, but after a day or two, I grew to enjoy it and now feel fairly comfortable - there's still much left to learn, however.
  
  Figuring out how to account for mouseclick position with different screen widths was unexpectedly challenging, but was quickly solved with some Google-fu and simple math.

  Built with TypeScript, React and Firebase. TypeScript for the learning experience (and, of course, the benefits of strong typing), React for its speed and ease of use and Firebase to keep player scores.
